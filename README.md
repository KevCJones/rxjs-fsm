# rxjs-fsm
Just a finite statemachine done with RXJS. Will need some love before its production ready like tests, but it's not complicated, so it's probably safe if you need it, use it.

## Why?

Because i needed it, and it was a good test of remind myself how to write one but to write one using rxjs.

## Examples

#### Stackblitz playground

## TODO

- Write tests
- Configure CI
- Write better docs
- Add some examples
- Consider visual outputs for FSM
