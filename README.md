# rxjs-fsm ![https://travis-ci.org/KevCJones/rxjs-fsm.svg?branch=master](https://travis-ci.org/KevCJones/rxjs-fsm.svg?branch=master)
Just a finite statemachine done with RXJS. Will need some love before its production ready like tests, but it's not complicated, so it's probably safe if you need it, use it.

## Why?

Because i needed it, and it was a good test of remind myself how to write one but to write one using rxjs.
